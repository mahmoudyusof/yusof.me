# Nuxt 3 - An Introduction

I believe many of us already know what a meta framework is (the Next.js team are making enough noise), so let's not waste time going through that again.  

In this article I'll focus on the Vue.js meta framework Nuxt version 3. If you've used Nuxt 2, hold on to your seat, there has been a lot of changes.  

> This Article is not going to be a comparison between Nuxt 3 and any other meta framework even Nuxt 2, however, we might highlight where Nuxt 3 might be unique to know why one should use it.

## Rendering modes

I believe everyone at this point knows what servers side rendering (SSR) is, some people argue that we've gone full circle since PHP templates.  
This is not the only whay, though, one can render a javascript app, as a matter of fact, you don't have to use only one way, you can use all, with universal rendering.

### Universal Rendering

We know SSR and CSR, but how about the best of both?  
You can split universal rendering into two steps

- SSR with the first page request getting the performance gains and SEO of SSR
- Then loading JS in the background and handing over the navigation controls to the client, gaining the benifits of
    - fast navigation
    - page transitions
    - low cost
    - etc...

### SSG

Remember Gridsome? I do, I believe it was the first tool to generate static sites using vue, then we had vuepress the viteperss for documentation websites. You can do this with Nuxt too using the `nuxt generate` or `nuxt build --prerender` command

### Hybrid Rendering

The larger the application you're building, the wider the variaty of pages you're going to have
- pages that have important content to be indexed, but are updated periodically (products for example)
- pages that have important content to be indexed, and are static (blog posts, landing pages)
- pages that have content you don't wish to be indexed (dashboards)

Each type of page has its own needs, you might need to use SSR for products pages, SSG for blog posts, CSR for dashboards etc...  

You can simply do this in Nuxt by defining the route rules in the nuxt config.  

```javascript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    // Homepage pre-rendered at build time
    '/': { prerender: true },

    // Products page generated on demand, revalidates in background, cached until API response changes
    '/products': { swr: true },

    // Product page generated on demand, revalidates in background, cached for 1 hour (3600 seconds)
    '/products/**': { swr: 3600 },

    // Blog posts page generated on demand, revalidates in background, cached on CDN for 1 hour (3600 seconds)
    '/blog': { isr: 3600 },

    // Blog post page generated on demand once until next deployment, cached on CDN
    '/blog/**': { isr: true },

    // Admin dashboard renders only on client-side
    '/admin/**': { ssr: false },

    // Add cors headers on API routes
    '/api/**': { cors: true },

    // Redirects legacy urls
    '/old-page': { redirect: '/new-page' }
  }
})

```

### Edge Side Rendering

Perhapse you've deployed some static files to a CDN before, this way the requests are served by the physically nearest server to the client.  
Now imagine if you can do it for non-static content too, instead of going all the way to a centeral server to do SSR and get the content, the closest edge server can do that for you reducing latency. Ofcourse this means the server code must be effecient and small in size to be able to run on edge machines. This is exactly what nitro did (the nuxt server).  
Nuxt server (Nitro) is built on top of unjs/h3 server which is basically a tree-shackable express. The usage of such server in the upgrade to Nuxt3 reduced cold start time from 300ms to around 3ms!!! allowing for the possibility of edge side rendering.  

Ofcourse this will only work on certain deployment solutions. which ones, you might ask. well ... anyone.

- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/){:target="_blank"} with zero configuration using the git integration and the `nuxt build` command
- [Vercel Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/features/edge-functions){:target="_blank"} using the `nuxt build` command and `NITRO_PRESET=vercel-edge` environment variable
- [Netlify Edge Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/#netlify-edge-functions){:target="_blank"} using the `nuxt build` command and `NITRO_PRESET=netlify-edge` environment variable

> **NOTE:** There are other presets that allow you to deploy to different environments like bun or deno. This is done using unjs/unenv package.  
> Check some of the presets in the [unjs/nitro](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/tree/main/src/presets){:target="_blank"} repository

## Data Fetching

There are plenty of ways one can handle data fetching in Nuxt3, however, the recommended way is to use the composables provided by Nuxt like `useFetch` and `useAsyncData`. let's take a look at the provided APIs

### Ofetch and $fetch

The way that is closest to the browser provided `fetch` is th `$fetch` method built using unjs/ofetch, however, this is much much better.  

Remember when you had to serialize javascript objects yourself using fetch?  
Remember when you had to deserialize json string from the response using fetch?

You don't have to this using `$fetch`

```javascript
const response = await $fetch("/api/post", {
  method: "POST",
  body: {key: "value"} // no need to serilize POJOs
}) // no need to await again to get the json response
```

> **PROTIP:** You can use typescript auto complition for your nuxt internal endpoints by enabling the experamintal feature.
> ```javascript [nuxt.config.ts]
> export default defineNuxtConfig({
>   experimental: {
>      typedPages: true,
>    } 
> })
> ```
> ![typedPages](/typedPages.png)


### useFetch

There are a couple of composables built on top of unjs/ofetch, one of which is called `useFetch`.  
Using it gives one the same benefits of using `$fetch` and more.  
- Caching
- Automatic resend request if watch list changes
- Ability to pick fields or completely transform response apon success

The `useFetch` composable returns a handfull of useful functions and refs
- `data` The actual response data
- `refresh` a method to resend the request if needed
- `execute` the same as refresh but named for a different use (don't you just love good API design!!)
- `pending`, `error`, `status` refs for checking the request status.


> **PROTIP:** You can get E2E type checks if your backend endpoints live in the same nuxt application, meaning you have to define the types only once and get the goodies of types on both ends.

> Note that I am not defining any types on the frontend.

### useAsyncData

If you need more control over the data fetching mechanism without loosing the goodies `useFetch` provides, the maybe you should consider using `useAsyncData`

### Caching

### E2E type safety

### Bypassing network during hydration

### useLazyFetch



## Lazy Components

### auto imports more lazy

## Global State Management

### useState (SSR Friendly)


## Server

### Creating API Endpoints

### Caching API Endpoints

## Deployment

### easy deployment to netlify
