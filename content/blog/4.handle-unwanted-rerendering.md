# Handle Unwanted Re-Rendering In Vue

Maybe you've asked yourself before "why is this component re-rendering?" or "why is this request being sent again?" or "If only there's a way to explicitly specify which state this component tracks!" then continue reading.  

In this article we will go through when to expect component re-renders and how to avoid unwanted re-rendering. But let't start from the beginning.

## How Reactivity Works in Vue/React

At this point the term 'virtual DOM' doesn't scare anyone, it has been the way React, Angular and Vue handle reactivity (this is about to change and we'll talk about it), but let's go through how reactivity works in loose terms.  
- Initially a VDOM tree is constructed with all the components
- When the state of a particular component changes, a VDOM sub-tree is re-evaluated
- Then a diff between the current and next VDOM is computed
- Finally the DOM updates are performed

> **NOTE** This is not the case for frameworks like Qwik and Solid as they reflect state changes to the DOM directly, more about that in future articles.

In React and Angular, this VDOM sub-tree starts from the component which owns the state change and affects all of its children.  
In vue, however, things are a bit different.

## Refs (signals before they were cool)

We can think of signals as values that one can read, update, or watch (subscribe to).  
Given that discription, signals are literally refs in vue (but yall like solid).  

In a vue component, if that component is reading the value of a ref then it is automatically watching (or subscribing to) that ref as well, which means any component that uses this value will render when that value changes.

In the light of the previous statement let's take a look at the following structure

```vue [Parent.vue]
<template>
    <MidComponent :state="state" />
</template>
```

```vue [MidComponent.vue]
<template>
    <Child :state="state" />
</template>
```

Again in the light of that statement above, one would assume that if `MidComponent` doesn't use `state`, then if it changes that wouldn't cause it to re-render, right? (React devs ofcourse don't think so).  

Well no really, the reason being that passing state as props even if they are not used in the component unwraps a ref, which means that the intermediate component is now a subscriber to that ref/signal.  

Luckely there is an easy solution for that problem.

## Provide / Inject

As we said passing props to a component even if the component is not using the value of these props results in:
1. Prop drilling
2. unwanted rendering (unwanted subscribing to the signal `ref`)

The provide / inject patterns solves both of those problems, and here is how it works

```vue [Parent.vue]
<template>
    <MidComponent />
</template>

<script setup>
    import {ref, provide} from "vue";
    const count = ref(0);
    provide("count", count);
</script>
```

```vue [Child.vue]
<template>
    <span>{{ count }}</span>
</template>

<script setup>
    import { inject } from "vue";
    const count = inject("count");
</script>
```

## Reduce Dependencies with `v-once` and `v-memo`

These are rarely used directives in vue, so I believe it is better to describe a usecase before we talk about them.  
Let's take a look at the following code.

```vue [Form.vue]
<template>
    <form @submit.prevent="handleSubmit">
        <input type="text" placeholder="Username" v-model="username" />
        <input type="email" placeholder="email" v-model="password" />

        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>

    <Serializer :username="username" :password="password" :response="response" />
</template>

<script setup>
    import {ref} from "vue"
    const username = ref("")
    const password = ref("")
    const response = ref(null)

    const handleSubmit = () => {
        fetch("/api").then(res => res.json()).then(res => {
            response.value = res
        }).catch(e => {
            // error handling
        })
    }
</script>
```

```vue [Serializer.vue]
<template>
    <div>
        <p>username: {{ username }}</p>
        <p>password: {{ password }}</p>
        <pre>
            {{ JSON.stringify(response) }}
        </pre>
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
    defineProps({
        username: String,
        password: String,
        response: Object
    })
</script>

```

Now even though `Serializer` takes in `username` and `password` as props, we might not want it to trigger a render everytime they change, we might want to change only when we get a different response. We can achieve such behaviour using the `v-memo` directive like so:

```vue [Form.vue]
<template>
<!-- ... -->
    <Serializer :username="username" :password="password" :response="response" v-memo="[response]" />
<!-- ... -->
</template>
```

This tells vue that the only dependency is `response`, if we pass and empty array that would indicate that we only want to render a snapshot of the props, which is what `v-once` directive does. In that case the component only renders when its internal state changes, not caring about the parent's state.  

## Conclusion

We can summarize the previous to the following points:
- Vue uses refs (signals) to know exactly which components to render.
- When a ref is passed as a prop, the component subscribes to it even if it doesn't read it.
- You can use Provide / Inject to avoid this behaviour and prop drilling.
- You can define explicitly which refs to watch by using the `v-memo` directive or opt-out completely by using `v-once` directive.
